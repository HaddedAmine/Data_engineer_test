# Data Engineering Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
"In this project, we've developed our data pipeline in two distinct approaches. The first approach utilizes Apache Airflow, offering a robust and scalable framework suitable for complex workflows. The second approach simplifies the process, implementing the pipeline as a series of straightforward Python jobs for a more direct and lightweight execution. Each method has its unique advantages and use cases, and we encourage exploring both to understand their individual strengths. For more detailed insights into each approach, please refer to the respective READMEs: Airflow [README](Airflow/README.md) for the Airflow implementation and Simple Flow [README](simpleflow/README.md) for the straightforward job approach."
